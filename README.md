# Larry

Larry is a simple Discord bot that interacts with the OpenAI GTP3 API. The bot keeps track of the conversation per guild
individually. You need to supply your own GPT3 key for this to work. Larry currently only keeps the last 20 lines of a
conversation, to limit token usage.

## Commands

- `larry help`: show all available commands
- `larry reset`: reset the conversation
